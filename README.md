Certainly! Here's a basic README for your `threadedreturn` package:

---

# threadedreturn

`threadedreturn` is a Python package that provides a simple extension to the built-in `Thread` class in the `threading` module. The `ThreadWithReturnValue` class in this package allows you to create threads with return values.

## Installation

You can install `threadedreturn` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install threadedreturn
```

## Usage

### ThreadWithReturnValue

`ThreadWithReturnValue` is a subclass of `Thread` that enables you to retrieve the return value of a function or method running in a separate thread.

#### Example

```python
from threadedreturn import ThreadWithReturnValue

# Define a function to be executed in a separate thread
def my_function(arg1, arg2):
    # Some time-consuming task
    result = arg1 + arg2
    return result

# Create a ThreadWithReturnValue instance
thread = ThreadWithReturnValue(target=my_function, args=(3, 5))

# Start the thread
thread.start()

# Wait for the thread to finish and retrieve the return value
result = thread.join()

print("Result:", result)
```
